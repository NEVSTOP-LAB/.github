üßô **[Libraries](https://github.com/search?q=topic%3Aframework+org%3ANEVSTOP-LAB+fork%3Atrue&type=repositories)**

| Library Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [LabVIEW TagDB Library](https://github.com/NEVSTOP-LAB/LabVIEW-TagDB) | This library sets are used to manage tag/configuration data in large applications. |
| [LabVIEW TagDB Reference Manager Library](https://github.com/NEVSTOP-LAB/LabVIEW-TagDB-RefMgr) | This library manage the front panel references and provide a shortcut Vis for UI refreshing |
